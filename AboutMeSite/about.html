		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> My name is Stefanos Ugbit. My parents are from Eritrea a small country in east Africa. They were refugees who fled from war and had a long ardous journey. These experiences of my parents and my upbringing helped foster my intellectual curosity in studying economic development.  I study economics sand minor in Arabic at the City College of New York. This past summer, I recieved the Gilman scholarship which allowed me to study Arabic abroad and do economics research in the University of Jordan. This was a tremendous opportunity for me because I was able to improve my langauge ability and gain cross-cultural communication skills. It was a humbling experience to get to explore a new place and be immersed within the culture to have a better understanding of different perspectives across the globe. In the future I want to merge new and/or existing technology in order to help foster sustainable economic development in the developing world and in underserved communities. </p>

					<h4>On Pain</h4> <!-- One of my favorite poems from my favorite poet-->
 					Kahlil Gibran
 		<p>
Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.
And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.


Much of your pain is self-chosen.
It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:
For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,
And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.
